# TrafficSystem
### Goals
The main goal of this system is to gain the ability to repeatedly measure the traffic created by closing a specific number of lanes for a specific length of road. Existing reasearch has struggled to analyze traffic in construction zones due to the sheer number of factors that effect real-world traffic. By creating a simplified, repeatable system without the environmental factors of a complex system, general conclusions on the effect of construction on traffic systems will be able to be confidently drawn.

### Overall Plan for the Simulation
